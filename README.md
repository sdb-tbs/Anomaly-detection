# Anomaly-detection
In this project, we perform anomaly detection on time series dataset containing energy consumption data of some store for some given days in the past where the store was working at an acceptable level of energy consumption (every day in the train_data can be considered good data, i.e. the store was working at an acceptable level).
Energy and enthalpy variables are given. A relationship between enthalpy (average daily outside air enthalpy) and energy (the total store energy consumption) exists (enthalpy is the independent variable, and energy is the dependent variable).

based on this information in hand different models are applied and ensembled at the end.
